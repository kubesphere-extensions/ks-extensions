## Core Features

- Blue-green deployment: Create identical standby environments and run new application versions to ensure avoidance of downtime or service interruption.
- Canary release: Slowly push changes to a small portion of users to minimize version upgrade risks.
- Traffic mirroring: Replicate real-time production traffic and send it to mirroring services.
- Traffic monitoring: Visually displays the traffic situation between each microservice, and supports users to configure current limiting and circuit breakers.
- Link tracking: Visually displays key information such as the mutual calling relationship, span, and time consumption between each microservice.
