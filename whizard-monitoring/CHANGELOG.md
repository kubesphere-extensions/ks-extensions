## v1.1.0

`WhizardTelemetry Monitoring` is an extension component of the WhizardTelemetry observability platform that provides monitoring functionality. It offers multi-tenant views of cloud-native resource monitoring capabilities, including real-time and historical data displays of key monitoring metrics for clusters, nodes, workloads, GPUs, and Kubernetes control planes.

With `WhizardTelemetry Monitoring`, you can deploy and manage the following components:

- Kube-Prometheus-Stack
  
  Kube-Prometheus-Stack is a monitoring stack for Kubernetes clusters and the applications running on them, using Prometheus. It includes Prometheus Operator, kube-state-metrics, node-exporter, and other components, as well as configuration lists for collecting Kubernetes component metrics and related Prometheus rules.

- Whizard Monitoring Helper

  A helper tool for deploying `WhizardTelemetry Monitoring`.

- DCGM-Exporter

  DCGM-Exporter is an exporter for collecting Nvidia GPU performance and health metrics.

### API Updates

- Monitoring APIs have been integrated into the `WhizardTelemetry Platform Service`. For API changes, refer to the [WhizardTelemetry Platform Service changelog](https://github.com/kubesphere-extensions/ks-extensions/tree/main/whizard-telemetry/CHANGELOG_en.md#api-updates).

### Features

- Kube-Prometheus-Stack is fully compatible with the community project [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus).
- DCGM-Exporter has optimized the default metric configurations, supporting the collection of more GPU metrics.

### Enhancements
